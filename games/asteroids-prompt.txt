Create a multidirectional vector shooter titled "Debris Automata" situated in a toroidal (screen-wrapping) environment. The player pilots a triangular vessel equipped with rotational controls and a thrust mechanic that applies inertia-based movement. The primary antagonists are not static sprites, but drifting "Colony Clusters"—floating, independent grids containing active cellular automata simulations. These clusters move with their own velocity and rotation across the screen, bouncing off each other while internally running Conway's Game of Life rules at a slow, rhythmic tick rate. The player's goal is to fire projectiles that function as "cell deleters." When a projectile strikes a "live" cell within a cluster, that specific cell is destroyed. Crucially, the game must implement a real-time "integrity check" or connected-component algorithm: if a player's shot destroys a connecting cell and severs a cluster into two non-contiguous groups of live cells, the cluster must physically split into two smaller, separate entity objects with divergent momentum vectors. This mimics the fragmentation mechanic of the genre but driven entirely by the topology of the grid. The game ends if the player's ship collides with any "live" cell, and victory is achieved when the screen is entirely void of biological activity.
