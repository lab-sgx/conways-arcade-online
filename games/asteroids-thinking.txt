My architectural strategy for "Debris Automata" required solving a complex conflict between <span class="highlight red">continuous vector physics</span> and discrete grid logic.

I started by deconstructing the original genre's core loop—breaking large threats into smaller, faster threats—and sought a way to replicate that utilizing <span class="highlight green">cellular morphology</span> rather than arbitrary hit-point thresholds. The breakthrough came in defining the enemies not as a single background layer, but as individual "floating canvases" or <span class="highlight blue">local grids</span>. This allows the clusters to drift and rotate smoothly (sub-pixel movement) while maintaining the rigid integer-based structure required for the automata rules.

I spent considerable time mentally simulating the <span class="highlight yellow">"fragmentation logic"</span>: I realized that simply killing a cell wasn't enough; the system needs to run a flood-fill or <span class="highlight red">connected-component analysis</span> after every impact to detect if the "island" of cells has been bisected. If it has, the physics engine must dynamically instantiate a new parent object for the severed chunk, calculating a new trajectory to simulate an explosion. I also emphasized the <span class="highlight yellow">toroidal topology</span> (screen wrapping) because it aligns perfectly with the mathematical boundary conditions often used in academic Conway's Game of Life simulations, creating a seamless, claustrophobic arena.

Finally, I decided that the Conway's "Game of Life" rules should act as a <span class="highlight green">passive regeneration mechanic</span>—if the player is too slow to destroy a cluster, the inherent B3/S23 rules might cause a small fragment to grow back into a massive, screen-clogging blockage, punishing hesitation with exponential biological growth.
