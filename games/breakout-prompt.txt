Develop a 2D arcade physics game titled "Cellular Shatter" where the player controls a horizontal paddle situated at the bottom of the screen, moving strictly along the x-axis to deflect a bouncing projectile upwards into a grid of target blocks. Unlike traditional static targets, the upper portion of the screen is populated by a dynamic grid running Conway's Game of Life algorithm (B3/S23 rules). The projectile behaves as a "sterilizer"; when it collides with a "live" cell, it not only rebounds based on the angle of incidence but also immediately sets that cell's state to "dead." The core challenge lies in the grid's ability to regenerate: the simulation advances one generation at a fixed time interval (e.g., every 3 seconds), potentially causing "dead" areas to fill back in or new structures to spawn if the player is not aggressive enough. The game physics must handle collision detection against a constantly mutating discrete topology, ensuring the ball bounces correctly off the current "live" edges of the automata. The objective is to achieve total extinction (zero live cells on the grid) before the player runs out of lives by letting the projectile fall below the paddle, effectively turning the gameplay into a race against biological exponential growth.
