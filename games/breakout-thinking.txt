My conceptual framework for "Cellular Shatter" involved analyzing the <span class="highlight red">core loop of block-breaking games</span>—systematic destruction of a finite structure—and inverting it by introducing infinite regenerative potential. 

I realized that the standard static wall of bricks offers no strategic depth beyond aiming, whereas a <span class="highlight green">cellular automata grid</span> acts as an opponent that actively repairs itself. This shifts the player's mindset from "cleaning up" to "containing an outbreak," creating a sense of urgency. I had to carefully consider the <span class="highlight red">collision logic</span>: usually, physics engines rely on pre-baked geometry, but here the "level" changes shape every few seconds. Therefore, I decided the collision system must check the ball's vector against the grid's integer coordinates in real-time, treating every "live" cell as a solid 1x1 AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for that specific frame. 

I also deliberated on the <span class="highlight yellow">evolution tick rate</span>. If it's too fast, the player feels helpless; if too slow, it's trivial. I settled on a medium-paced timer independent of the ball speed, which forces the player to prioritize "keystone" cells—killing a specific cell that supports a whole cluster—thereby leveraging the <span class="highlight blue">underpopulation rule</span> (death by isolation) as a weapon. This transforms the paddle from a passive deflector into a tool for surgical strikes against the <span class="highlight yellow">morphology</span> of the pattern. 

Finally, I decided that the "win state" must be absolute <span class="highlight green">extinction</span>, reinforcing the theme of fighting a resilient, microscopic organism.
