Create a single-player infinite runner game for web browsers titled "Automata Rush" The visual style should be a monochromatic pixel-art aesthetic where the background is a scrolling discrete grid. The player controls a sprite of a small dinosaur that runs in place on the left side of the screen while the grid moves rapidly from right to left. The objective is to survive as long as possible by jumping over or ducking under procedurally generated obstacles derived from cellular automata patterns. Ground-based obstacles, replacing traditional barriers, should be rendered as "Still Life" patterns (such as Blocks, Beehives, or Loaves) that remain static on the grid floor. Aerial obstacles must be dynamic "Oscillator" or "Spaceship" patterns (like Blinkers, Toads, or Gliders) that float at varying heights, requiring the player to crouch or time their jump carefully. The control scheme involves using the Spacebar/Up Arrow to jump (with gravity pulling the dinosaur back down) and the Down Arrow to crouch (reducing the sprite's hit area). As the game progresses, the scrolling speed of the grid accelerates, reducing reaction time. The game ends instantly if any non-transparent pixel of the dinosaur sprite overlaps with a "live" cell of an obstacle pattern, triggering a "Game Over" screen with the final distance score.
