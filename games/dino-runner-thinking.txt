My design approach for "Automata Rush" focused on creating a deliberate <span class="highlight yellow">visual dissonance</span> by juxtaposing a recognizable, organic protagonist against a strictly mathematical and algorithmic environment. 
I chose to retain the dinosaur as a distinct sprite—rather than converting it into a cell pattern—to metaphorically represent a <span class="highlight red">biological anomaly</span> attempting to survive within a sterile, computational machine. When translating the mechanics of a standard runner, I had to strictly categorize the Conway's <span class="highlight green">Game of Life patterns</span> by their behavioral properties to fit gameplay archetypes: <span class="highlight blue">"Still Lifes"</span> were selected for ground hazards because their unchanging nature makes them reliable, wall-like barriers, whereas <span class="highlight blue">"Oscillators"</span> were chosen for aerial threats because their shifting shapes introduce a variable hitbox, forcing the player to judge not just the position but the timing of the obstacle's cycle.
Technically, I envisioned the world generation not as loading pre-made asset chunks, but as a <span class="highlight red">procedural grid injection</span> system where specific columns are populated with live cells on the rightmost edge based on a randomized difficulty curve. This necessitated a hybrid <span class="highlight red">collision detection system</span> that checks the continuous float position of the sprite against the discrete integer coordinates of the grid, ensuring that the "hitbox" is pixel-perfect to the cell structure. Furthermore, I decided that the "Gliders" should technically move independently of the global scroll speed to mimic the erratic flight patterns of birds in similar games, adding a layer of relative velocity calculation that creates distinct parrying windows for the user.
Ultimately, the goal was to use the <span class="highlight green">cellular automata</span> not just as a texture, but as the logic driving the physical boundaries of the play space.
