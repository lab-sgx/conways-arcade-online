Create a side-scrolling arcade game titled "Hoppy Glider" set within a strict cellular automata grid environment. The player controls a "Glider"—the famous 5-cell pattern from Conway's Game of Life—which is subjected to simulated gravity, constantly falling downwards within the grid. The core input mechanic is a single "tap" or "click" that imparts an immediate upward vertical impulse, counteracting gravity to keep the Glider afloat. The objective is to navigate the Glider through openings in vertical barrier structures that scroll from right to left. These barriers are constructed from static "dead" or "live" cell columns, resembling the "tubes" or "walls" seen in similar physics games, but rendered as discrete grid blocks. Crucially, the Glider sprite should cycle through its four evolutionary phases (animation frames) based on a timer independent of the game physics, meaning the player's hitbox changes slightly every few milliseconds. A "Game Over" state is triggered if any "live" cell of the player's Glider overlaps with a "live" cell of a wall, or touches the top/bottom boundaries of the grid. The score increments for every vertical barrier successfully passed.
