Create a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up (shmup) titled "Cellship Strike". The player pilots a ship at the bottom of the screen that flies upward through a constantly generating field of "Agar"—random noise that evolves according to B3/S23 rules. Unlike traditional shooters where enemies are sprites, the enemies here are vast, connected regions of "live" cells. The player's weapon is a "De-Life Beam," a rapid-fire projectile that turns any "live" cell it touches into a "dead" cell. The core loop involves carving a path through dense "biological walls" or destroying specific "Organelles" (dense clusters like "Puffers") that generate trails of debris. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, forcing the player to clear the path ahead or be crushed against the bottom edge. Power-ups should not be icons, but specific "glider" patterns the player can catch; catching one changes the player's weapon mode (e.g., catching a Glider gives a diagonal spread shot). The boss battles are massive "Breeder" patterns that grow quadratically, filling the screen with cells, requiring the player to target the "seed" cells to halt the growth.
