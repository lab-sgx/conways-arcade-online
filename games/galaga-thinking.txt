When conceptualizing "Cellship Strike" I wanted to subvert the <span class="highlight red">bullet-hell genre</span> by making the environment itself the bullet. In a standard shooter, space is empty and bullets are the threat; here, the <span class="highlight green">cellular biomass</span> occupies 80% of the screen, creating a claustrophobic "tunneling" experience rather than an open-sky dogfight.

My focus was heavily on the <span class="highlight yellow">weaponization of the user's input</span>. I decided that the act of shooting shouldn't just be "damage," but "erasure." This led to the train of thought regarding "regeneration": if the player shoots a hole in a wall, the B3/S23 rules might naturally close that hole up in the next tick if the surrounding density is high (birth condition).

This creates a <span class="highlight blue">dynamic difficulty</span> where the player must shoot faster than the simulation can heal, effectively fighting the algorithm's reproduction rate. I also struggled with the "Boss" concept until I realized that in automata theory, "Breeders" are essentially engines of infinite growth. Using a <span class="highlight blue">Quadratic Growth pattern</span> as a boss forces the player to identify the source of the pattern (the "gun") rather than just shooting the mass, adding a tactical puzzle element to the frantic action. 

The scrolling mechanic was the final piece; it acts as the <span class="highlight red">pressure variable</span>, forcing the player to make snap decisions about which cellular structures are thin enough to blast through and which are too dense to risk engaging.
