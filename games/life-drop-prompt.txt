Create a simulation of "Conway's Game of Life". The visual output is a standard orthogonal grid where cells evolve according to the B3/S23 ruleset, but the user's primary point of focus is a high-contrast "Cursor" frame that overlays a single grid coordinate. The joystick input must map to discrete movement, shifting the cursor one cell at a time across the X and Y axes with a slight input repeat delay to allow for precision. "Button 1" acts as the "State Modifier," instantly toggling the specific cell directly beneath the cursor between "live" and "dead" statuses; this input must remain responsive even while the simulation is actively processing generations, allowing for real-time interference. "Button 2" functions as the "Master Clock Toggle," switching the simulation state between "Paused" (static) and "Running" (updating at a fixed tick rate). The UI must clearly visualize the simulation status (e.g., a "PLAY/PAUSE" icon) without obstructing the grid. The objective is to provide a tactile, console-like experience where constructing complex patterns like Glider Guns requires deliberate navigation rather than rapid clicking.
