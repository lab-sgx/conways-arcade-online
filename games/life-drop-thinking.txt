My design philosophy for this specific iteration of "Conway's Game of Life" was centered on the concept of <span class="highlight red">intentional friction</span>. By removing the mouse—which allows for random access and rapid "painting"—and replacing it with a <span class="highlight red">joystick-driven cursor</span>, I fundamentally altered the user's relationship with the grid from that of an omnipotent architect to a localized operator.

I had to carefully consider the <span class="highlight yellow">cursor logic</span>; unlike a mouse pointer, a grid cursor exists at a coordinate rather than floating above it, meaning the visualization needs to invert the colors of the cell beneath it or use a thick border to ensure visibility on both "live" and "dead" backgrounds. The decision to allow "Button 1" to function during the active simulation was critical; it transforms the experience from a passive observation into an active <span class="highlight red">feedback loop</span> where the user can frantically try to patch "leaks" in a stabilizing pattern or sabotage a growing structure in real-time.

I also mentally simulated the <span class="highlight blue">input handling</span> for the joystick: purely analog movement would be too slippery for a discrete grid, so I mandated a digital "tap-to-move" or "hold-to-scroll" logic to ensure the user can target single pixels with precision. 

Ultimately, this control scheme recontextualizes the <span class="highlight green">cellular automata simulation</span>, making the act of creating a simple "Blinker" feel like a mechanical accomplishment rather than a trivial click, emphasizing the digital physicality of the <span class="highlight blue">B3/S23 algorithm</span>.
