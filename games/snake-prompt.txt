Develop a grid-based movement game titled "Trail of Life". The player controls a "Head Cell" that moves continuously in one of four cardinal directions. Instead of a static tail, the trail left behind by the player consists of "live" cells that immediately begin to interact with each other according to Conway's Game of Life rules (B3/S23) after a short delay (e.g., 5 ticks). The objective is to collect "Food Cells" (static Blocks) which add length to the initial input trail. The twist is that the tail does not simply follow the head; it evolves, breaks apart, and forms independent "Still Lifes" or "Oscillators" based on the shape of the path the player drew. The player dies if the Head Cell collides with any "live" cell, including their own evolved tail or the grid boundaries. This means a careless turn can create a "glider" that shoots forward and kills the player 10 seconds later. The score is based on the number of generations the player survives and the amount of stable biomass created on the grid.
