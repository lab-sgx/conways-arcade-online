Develop a 2D arcade shooter titled "Cellfront Command" where the user pilots a ship fixed to the bottom horizontal axis, moving left and right to fire vertical projectiles at an encroaching enemy force. This enemy force is not a set of static sprites but a dynamic "Cellfront Grid" occupying the top 70% of the screen, running a simulation of Conway's Game of Life (B3/S23 rules). The simulation must advance one generation at a slow, fixed "tick" interval (e.g., 0.5 seconds), distinct from the 60 FPS game loop, creating a rhythmic, creeping expansion threat. The player's primary mechanic is to shoot upwards; if a projectile strikes a "live" cell, that cell is instantly set to "dead" for the next generation, allowing the player to prune and shape the enemy structure. To attack the player, every "live" cell on the grid has a small random probability each frame to drop a damaging projectile downwards, creating a chaotic "rain" that erodes the player's destructible shield bunkers and threatens the ship. The game concludes with a victory if the player successfully reduces the live cell count to zero, or a defeat if the player is destroyed or if the simulation evolves a live cell past a visual "Invasion Line" separating the grid from the player's zone. Level progression should introduce increasingly volatile initial cell patterns, such as "guns" or "puffers," to ramp up the difficulty.
